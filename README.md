- 👋 Hi, I’m @hsowschultz
- 👀 I'm interested in exploring new technologies and solving real-world problems with code. I enjoy learning new languages, frameworks and tools that can help me create better software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance user experiences and optimize performance. I'm also interested in web development, data science, and cybersecurity.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects that have a positive impact on society and the environment. I'm passionate about education, health, sustainability and accessibility. I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can send me an email, a text, a DM, or a carrier pigeon. Just don't call me, because I hate talking on the phone. It makes me nervous and I tend to say awkward things.
